I am a professional web developer and designer with a passion for all things tech.  Ever since the day I logged into my
first BBS server I knew what I wanted to do.  As services like Prodigy became available I started toying around and learning
about the new world wide web.  After a few gif filled sites on Geocities I needed to learn more and 
started my path into application development. 

In early 2000 I started a website development company named Immerse Graphics which as the name implies initially supplied
graphics services.  Some time after I released my custom CMS system Immprove which was designed with the simple goal of 
having no admin sections.  After some experience with WordPress and Drupal I saw people got confused when switching between
the public page and administration.  To solve that problem Immprove was created to allow live editing on the page you are 
on.

Currently I spend most of my time working in the LAMP stack and specialize in object oriented PHP, Javascript and Design.
Whenever possible I work to adhere to SOLID design principles and TDD, and passion for design has never faded. I work 
hard to balance both the back and front end of every application.
