    <p>
        Working on a recent project using MEAN.js I wanted to add support for managing my styles with <strong>LESS.js</strong>.  After
        building the application using the <strong>yeoman</strong> generator I was a little surprised that it didn't make
        use of if by default.  Though adding it to the grunt configuration is easy and only takes a minute.

        <h3>Installing dependencies</h3>

        <p>
            First you will need to install the <strong>less</strong> and <strong>grunt-contib-less</strong> packages
            using <strong>npm</strong>.
        </p>
        <code>$ npm install --save less grunt-contrib-less</code>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Optionally add a folder for .less sources</h3>

        <p>
            Personally I like to keep source files like less and scss out of my public folder. This is not really a
            requirement though I find it easier to organize things like this.
        </p>
        <code>$ mkdir -p assets/less</code>
    </section>

        <h3>Configuring Grunt</h3>
        <h4>Adding the watcher</h4>

        <p>
            Next you will need to tell <strong>Grunt</strong> how to handle .less files and update the file watchers.
            Open up <strong>gruntfile.js</strong> in the root of your MEAN.js app and in the <code>initConfig.watch</code>
            options, add a new option for less files under the clientCSS option. I named mine <code>clientLESS</code>
            but you can enter any you like so long as it is unique.
        </p>
        {% highlight javascript %}
        grunt.initConfig({
            pkg: grunt.file.readJSON('package.json'),
            watch: {
                ...
                clientCSS: {...}
                clientLESS: {
                    files: ['assets/less/*.less','public/modules/**/*.less'],
                    tasks: ['less']
                }
            }
        ...
        {% endhighlight %}
        <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> If you decided not to create an assets folder then you can remove the first option in
            files.
        </p>
        <h4>Configuring less</h4>

        <p>
            Now tell the <strong>less</strong> configuration where to find source files and what to do with them. I
            chose to consolidate all the styles into the application core.css. Since this is an <strong>AngularJS</strong>
            application it is best to have all the needed styles available right away.  I added the following below the
            <code>csslint</code> configuration.
        </p>
        {% highlight javascript %}
less: {
    development: {
        options: {
            paths: []
        },
        files: [{
            src: ['assets/less/*.less', 'public/modules/**/*.less'],
            dest: 'public/modules/core/css/core.css'
        }]
    },
    production: {
        options: {
            paths: []
        },
        files: [{
            src: ['assets/less/*.less', 'public/modules/**/*.less'],
            dest: 'public/modules/core/css/core.css'
        }]
    }
}
        {% endhighlight %}

        <p>
            Having a development and production environment specification are required and things will fail like this
            without them.
        </p>

        <p>
            <code>Warning: Object #&lt;Object&gt; has no method 'indexOf' Used --force, continuing.</code>
        </p>

        <p>
            For now they are the same but once the application is ready to deploy the production settings
            could be updated to run additional optimizations on your styles.
        </p>

        <h3>Updating the lint task to run less</h3>
        <p>
            Last you need to add less to the <strong>lint</strong> <code>grunt.registerTask</code> before the <strong>
            csslint</strong> task.  It should look like this:
        </p>
        {% highlight javascript %}
        grunt.registerTask('lint', ['jshint', 'less', 'csslint']);
        {% endhighlight %}
    </section>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            Setting this up was fairly straight forward, but I did use <strong>yeoman</strong> to generate the site.  If
            you started by checking out source from github or some other path things may not match.  Though there should
            be enough here to get it setup.
        </p>
        <p>
            An additional concern that popped into mind is upgrading.  I have not had to migrate to a new version yet and
            can not guarantee that these changes to the gruntfile will not be overwritten at that time.  Perhaps a better
            solution of including an external configuration should be looked at, or adding it as an option
            to the yeoman generator.
