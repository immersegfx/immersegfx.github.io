Having had a lot of fun creating sites using [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) I decided not to throw all my eggs in 
one basket and see what else it out there.  After some research I found 2 projects that interested me [Foundation 5](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
and [http://semantic-ui.com/](Semantic Ui).  They are both great alternatives to bootstrap and have large active communities.  The deciding factor 
for me was the difference in programming environments.  Foundation is built using SASS and required Ruby and Semantic UI requires Less and NodeJS.
