Over the years I have tried various platforms to store my ideas.  Wordpress, trac, redmine, blogger and a few others in 
between and although they are all great platforms often little issues that made the process cumbersome.  

With that in mind I started searching again with a few new requirements:
 
* I don't want to host the software or worry about keeping it up to date with security patches.
* Styling and updating needs to be fast and easy.  Without the need to learn a complicated theme format and variables. 
* Support local development that is simple to setup and sync between the various computers I use.  
* Syntax highlighting for code samples with support for a good set of languages.  

And after a bit of research it appears that I have found my candidate. 

### Setting up Jekyll and GitHub pages

There are a ton of different online resources covering the setup and install process so I won't go to much into 
detail on that front.  Instead I here are links to the pages and tutorials that I followed to get started. 

* [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/) - The Jekyll website
* [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/) - General instructions on how to get your initial GitHub pages 
repository setup.
* [jekyllbootstrap.com](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) - All the tools needed to get a working scaffold very quickly. 
Also provides rake tasks to help with common tasks.
